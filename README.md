### Development environment for the [Kivy framework](http://kivy.org) and [KivyMD library](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD).

As you already know, almost two years ago we started working on a development environment for the Kivy framework and the KivyMD library.
You can watch a small part of the results of this work on the official channel of the KivyMD library:

Only one person is working on the KivyMD Studio project. In the process of developing this software, I realized how much this is a huge job ...
It cannot be done by one person who comes at eight in the evening after work. Therefore, the project was suspended.
However, every day I receive many requests to resume work on this project. To do this,
I need to quit my main job for a period of 10 months (this is how long it will take to finish the KivyMD Studio project and make the first beta release).

In order not to be left without a livelihood during the development of KivyMD Studio,
I opened the [Open Collective of KivyMD Studio](https://opencollective.com/kivymd-studio) to collect sponsorship for the KivyMD Studio project.
As soon as we can reach the required amount of `$2,800`, the project will continue to develop.

For 10 months, every month in this repository there will be a publication of a video report on the work done. At the end of 10 months, the first push will be do
and the release of the beta version of the KivyMD Studio project. After that, everyone can make their own changes to the project for its further development.
